Hamlet is a play written by William Shakespeare that very ^M
closely follows the dramatic conventions of revenge in Elizabethan ^M
theater. All revenge tragedies originally stemmed from the Greeks, who ^M
wrote and performed the first plays. After the Greeks came Seneca who ^M
was very influential to all Elizabethan tragedy writers. Seneca who ^M
was Roman, basically set all of the ideas and the norms for all ^M
revenge play writers in the Renaissance era including William ^M
Shakespeare. The two most famous English revenge tragedies written in ^M
the Elizabethan era were Hamlet, written by Shakespeare and The ^M
Spanish Tragedy, written by Thomas Kyd. These two plays used mostly ^M
all of the Elizabethan conventions for revenge tragedies in their ^M
plays. Hamlet especially incorporated all revenge conventions in one ^M
way or another, which truly made Hamlet a typical revenge play. ^M
M-^SShakespeareM-^Rs Hamlet is one of many heroes of the Elizabethan and ^M
Jacobean stage who finds himself grievously wronged by a powerful ^M
figure, with no recourse to the law, and with a crime against his ^M
family to avenge.M-^T ^M
Seneca was among the greatest authors of classical tragedies ^M
and there was not one educated Elizabethan who was unaware of him or ^M
his plays. There were certain stylistic and different strategically ^M
thought out devices that Elizabethan playwrights including Shakespeare ^M
learned and used from SenecaM-^Rs great tragedies. The five act ^M
structure, the appearance of some kind of ghost, the one line ^M
exchanges known as stichomythia, and SenecaM-^Rs use of long rhetorical ^M
speeches were all later used in tragedies by Elizabethan playwrights. ^M
Some of SenecaM-^Rs ideas were originally taken from the Greeks when the ^M
Romans conquered Greece, and with it they took home many Greek ^M
theatrical ideas. Some of SenecaM-^Rs stories that originated from the ^M
Greeks like Agamemnon and Thyestes which dealt with bloody family ^M
histories and revenge captivated the Elizabethans. SenecaM-^Rs stories ^M
werenM-^Rt really written for performance purposes, so if English ^M
playwrights liked his ideas, they had to figure out a way to make the ^M
story theatrically workable, relevant and exciting to the Elizabethan ^M
audience who were very demanding. SenecaM-^Rs influence formed part of a ^M
developing tradition of tragedies whose plots hinge on political ^M
power, forbidden sexuality, family honor and private revenge. M-^SThere ^M
was no author who exercised a wider or deeper influence upon the ^M
Elizabethan mind or upon the Elizabethan form of tragedy than did ^M
Seneca.M-^T For the dramatists of Renaissance Italy, France and England, ^M
classical tragedy meant only the ten Latin plays of Seneca and not ^M
Euripides, Aeschylus and Sophocles. M-^SHamlet is certainly not much like ^M
any play of SenecaM-^Rs one can name, but Seneca is undoubtedly one of ^M
the effective ingredients in the emotional charge of Hamlet. Hamlet ^M
without Seneca is inconceivable.M-^T ^M
During the time of Elizabethan theater, plays about tragedy ^M
and revenge were very common and a regular convention seemed to be ^M
formed on what aspects should be put into a typical revenge tragedy. ^M
In all revenge tragedies first and foremost, a crime is committed and ^M
for various reasons laws and justice cannot punish the crime so the ^M
individual who is the main character, goes through with the revenge in ^M
spite of everything. The main character then usually had a period of ^M
doubt , where he tries to decide whether or not to go through with the ^M
revenge, which usually involves tough and complex planning. Other ^M
features that were typical were the appearance of a ghost, to get the ^M
revenger to go through with the deed. The revenger also usually had a ^M
very close relationship with the audience through soliloquies and ^M
asides. The original crime that will eventually be avenged is nearly ^M
always sexual or violent or both. The crime has been committed against ^M
a family member of the revenger. M-^S The revenger places himself outside ^M
the normal moral order of things, and often becomes more isolated as ^M
the play progresses-an isolation which at its most extreme becomes ^M
madness.M-^T The revenge must be the cause of a catastrophe and the ^M
beginning of the revenge must start immediately after the crisis. ^M
After the ghost persuades the revenger to commit his deed, a ^M
hesitation first occurs and then a delay by the avenger before killing ^M
the murderer, and his actual or acted out madness. The revenge must be ^M
taken out by the revenger or his trusted accomplices. The revenger and ^M
his accomplices may also die at the moment of success or even during ^M
the course of revenge. ^M
It should not be assumed that revenge plays parallel the moral ^M
expectations of the Elizabethan audience. Church, State and the ^M
regular morals of people in that age did not accept revenge, instead ^M
they thought that revenge would simply not under any circumstances be ^M
tolerated no matter what the original deed was. M-^S It is repugnant on ^M
theological grounds, since Christian orthodoxy posits a world ordered ^M
by Divine Providence, in which revenge is a sin and a blasphemy, ^M
endangering the soul of the revenger.M-^T The revenger by taking law into ^M
his own hands was in turn completely going against the total political ^M
authority of the state. People should therefore never think that ^M
revenge was expected by Elizabethan society. Although they loved to ^M
see it in plays, it was considered sinful and it was utterly ^M
condemned. ^M
The Spanish Tragedy written by Thomas Kyd was an excellent ^M
example of a revenge tragedy. With this play, Elizabethan theater ^M
received its first great revenge tragedy, and because of the success ^M
of this play, the dramatic form had to be imitated. The play was ^M
performed from 1587 to 1589 and it gave people an everlasting ^M
remembrance of the story of a father who avenges the murder of his ^M
son. In this story, a man named Andrea is killed by Balthazar in the ^M
heat of battle. The death was considered by Elizabethan people as a ^M
fair one, therefore a problem occurred when AndreaM-^Rs ghost appeared to ^M
seek vengeance on its killer. Kyd seemed to have used this to parallel ^M
a ghost named Achilles in SenecaM-^Rs play Troades. AndreaM-^Rs ghost comes ^M
and tells his father, Hieronimo that he must seek revenge. Hieronimo ^M
does not know who killed his son but he goes to find out. During his ^M
investigation, he receives a letter saying that Lorenzo killed his ^M
son, but he doubts this so he runs to the king for justice. Hieronimo ^M
importantly secures his legal rights before taking justice into his ^M
own hands. The madness scene comes into effect when HieronimoM-^Rs wife, ^M
Usable goes mad, and Hieronimo is so stunned that his mind becomes ^M
once again unsettled. Finally Hieronimo decides to go through with the ^M
revenge, so he seeks out to murder Balthazar and Lorenzo, which he ^M
successfully does. Hieronimo becomes a blood thirsty maniac and when ^M
the king calls for his arrest, he commits suicide.^M
As well as the fact that Elizabethan theater had its rules ^M
about how a revenge tragedy had to be, so did Thomas Kyd. He came up ^M
with the Kydian Formula to distinguish revenge tragedies from other ^M
plays. His first point was that the fundamental motive was revenge, ^M
and the revenge is aided by an accomplice who both commit suicide ^M
after the revenge is achieved. The ghost of the slain watches the ^M
revenge on the person who killed him. The revenger goes through ^M
justifiable hesitation before committing to revenge as a solution. ^M
Madness occurs due to the grieve of a loss. Intrigue is used against ^M
and by the revenger. There is bloody action and many deaths that ^M
occur throughout the entire play. The accomplices on both sides are ^M
killed. The villain is full of villainous devices. The revenge is ^M
accomplished terribly and fittingly. The final point that Thomas Kyd ^M
made about his play was that minor characters are left to deal with ^M
the situation at the end of the play.^M
The Spanish Tragedy follows these rules made by Kyd very ^M
closely, simply because Kyd developed these rules from the play. The ^M
fundamental motive was revenge because that was the central theme of ^M
the play. The ghost of Andrea sees his father kill the men who ^M
murdered Andrea originally. Hieronimo hesitates first because he goes ^M
to the king and then he is faced with IsabellaM-^Rs madness which is ^M
caused by AndreaM-^Rs death. The play is filled with all kinds of bloody ^M
action and many people die throughout the course of the play. The ^M
accomplices in the play also all end up dead. Lorenzo who is the true ^M
villain, is full of all kinds of evil villainous devices. The revenge ^M
works out perfectly, in that both Lorenzo and Balthazar get murdered ^M
in the end by Hieronimo. The minor characters were left to clean up ^M
the mess of all of the deaths that occurred during the play. The ^M
Spanish Tragedy also follows the conventions of Elizabethan theater ^M
very closely. The murder was committed and Hieronimo had to take ^M
justice into his own hands, because true justice just simply wasnM-^Rt ^M
available. Hieronimo then delays his revenge for many different ^M
reasons that occur in the play. The ghost of Andrea appeared and ^M
guided Hieronimo to the direction of his killer. Also at the end of ^M
the play, both Hieronimo and his accomplices die after they were ^M
successful in committing the revenge.^M
In Hamlet, Shakespeare follows regular convention for a large ^M
part of the play. In the beginning, Shakespeare sets up the scene, ^M
having a ghost on a dark night. Everyone is working and something ^M
strange is happening in Denmark. It is as if Shakespeare is saying ^M
that some kind of foul play has been committed. This sets up for the ^M
major theme in the play which is of course revenge. The ghost appears ^M
to talk to Hamlet. It is quite obvious that the play had a gruesome, ^M
violent death and the sexual aspect of the play was clearly introduced ^M
when Claudius married HamletM-^Rs mother Gertrude. The ghost tells Hamlet ^M
that he has been given the role of the person who will take revenge ^M
upon Claudius. Hamlet must now think of how to take revenge on ^M
Claudius, although he doesnM-^Rt know what to do about it. He ponders his ^M
thoughts for a long period of time, expecting to do the deed ^M
immediately, but instead he drags it on until the end of the play. ^M
Although what was important to note was that all tragic heroes of ^M
plays at that time delayed their actual revenge until the end of the ^M
play. In most revenge plays, the revenger was often anonymous and well ^M
disguised, stalking the enemy about to be killed, but Hamlet started a ^M
battle of wits with Claudius by acting mad and calling it his M-^Santic ^M
dispositionM-^T, although the whole thing was a ploy to get closer to ^M
Claudius to be able to avenge his fatherM-^Rs death more easily. The ^M
tactic was a disadvantage in that it drew all attention upon himself. ^M
More importantly though it was an advantage that his M-^Santic ^M
dispositionM-^T, isolated him from the rest of the court because of the ^M
people not paying attention to what he thought or did because of his ^M
craziness.^M
One important part of all revenge plays is that after the ^M
revenge is finally decided upon, the tragic hero delays the actual ^M
revenge until the end of the play. HamletM-^Rs delay of killing Claudius ^M
takes on three distinct stages. Firstly he had to prove that the ghost ^M
was actually telling the truth, and he did this by staging the play ^M
M-^SThe MousetrapM-^T at court. When Claudius stormed out in rage, Hamlet ^M
knew that he was guilty. The second stage was when Hamlet could have ^M
killed Claudius while he was confessing to god. If Hamlet had done it ^M
here then Claudius would have gone to heaven because he confessed ^M
while HamletM-^Rs father was in purgatory because he did not get the ^M
opportunity to confess. So Hamlet therefore decided not to murder ^M
Claudius at this point in the play. The third delay was the fact that ^M
he got side tracked. He accidentally killed Polonius which created a ^M
whole new problem with the fact that Laertes now wanted Hamlet dead. ^M
After he commit this murder he was also sent off and unable to see the ^M
king for another few weeks until he could finally do the job. M-^SWhat ^M
makes Hamlet stand out from many other revenge plays of the period is ^M
not that it rejects the conventions of its genre but that it both ^M
enacts and analyses them.M-^T ^M
It can be easily understood that Hamlet very closely follows ^M
the regular conventions for all Elizabethan tragedies. First Hamlet is ^M
faced with the fact that he has to avenge the murder of his father and ^M
since there is no fair justice available, he must take the law into ^M
his own hands. The ghost of his father appears to guide Hamlet to ^M
Claudius and inform Hamlet of the evil that Claudius has committed. ^M
Then Hamlet constantly delays his revenge and always finds a way to ^M
put it off until he finally does it in Act V, Scene 2. Hamlet at the ^M
same time continues to keep a close relationship with the audience ^M
with his seven main soliloquies including the famous, M-^STo be, or not ^M
to be...M-^T(Act 3 Scene 1). The play also consists of a mad scene where ^M
Ophelia has gone mad because her father Polonius had been killed and ^M
because Hamlet was sent off to England. The sexual aspect of the play ^M
was brought in when Claudius married Gertrude after he had dreadfully ^M
killed Old Hamlet and taken his throne. Hamlet also follows almost ^M
every aspect of Thomas KydM-^Rs formula for a revenge tragedy. The only ^M
point that can be argued is that the accomplices on both sides were ^M
not killed because at the end of the play, Horatio was the only one to ^M
survive, although if it wasnM-^Rt for Hamlet, Horatio would have commit ^M
suicide when he said, M-^S I am more an antique Roman than a Dane. HereM-^Rs ^M
some liquor left.M-^T(Act V Scene 2, 346-347). If Horatio had killed ^M
himself, then Hamlet would have followed the Kydian formula as well as ^M
the regular conventions for Elizabethan revenge tragedy.^M
Hamlet is definitely a great example of a typical revenge ^M
tragedy of the Elizabethan theater era. It followed every convention ^M
required to classify it as a revenge play quite perfectly. Hamlet is ^M
definitely one of the greatest revenge stories ever written and it was ^M
all influenced first by Sophocles, Euripides and other Greeks, and ^M
then more importantly by Seneca. Hamlet as well as The Spanish Tragedy ^M
tackled and conquered all areas that were required for the ^M
consummation of a great revenge tragedy. Revenge although thought to ^M
be unlawful and against the Church was absolutely adored by all ^M
Elizabethan people. M-^S The Elizabethan audience always insisted on ^M
seeing eventual justice, and one who stained his hands with blood had ^M
to pay the penalty. That no revenger, no matter how just, ever wholly ^M
escapes the penalty for shedding blood, even in error.M-^T This was also ^M
a very important point that was also dealt with brilliantly by ^M
Shakespeare in finding a way to kill Hamlet justly even though he was ^M
required to kill Claudius. Hamlet was written with the mighty pen of ^M
Shakespeare who once again shows people that he can conjure up any ^M
play and make it one of the greatest of all time. Hamlet was one of ^M
the greatest of all time.^M
